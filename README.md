# hi you ! I'm kiia-mari :-)

I'm a UI Artist & Designer based in Helsinki with a passion for crafting engaging, intuitive user interfaces. I’m currently on my third year of pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Digital Design (UI/UX) and working on creative projects that explore storytelling, UX/UI, and playful interaction.

🎮 **Right now, I am looking into opportunities in the game industry** — I'd love to contribute to creating games where players can focus on the fun with a seamless and accessible UI!

### Currently exploring:
- game UI/UX design workflows  
- learning the fundamentals of GitHub for version control and collaboration  
- implementing and optimizing assets in Unity
